# Personal Blog Website

This repository contains the code for my personal blog website. The website is built using Express.js, MongoDB Atlas, HTML, and CSS.

## Live Demo

You can view the live demo of the website at [https://personal-blogs-3hyo.onrender.com](https://personal-blogs-3hyo.onrender.com).

## Technologies Used

- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

- **MongoDB Atlas**: A fully-managed cloud database developed by the same people that build MongoDB.

- **HTML/CSS**: Used for structuring and styling the website.
